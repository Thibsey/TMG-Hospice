What do we offer?

Hospice Amsterdam Zuidoost wants to offer support to people in their last phase of life and to their loved ones. Sometimes it is not possible to spend this last phase at home. That is why Hospice Amsterdam Zuidoost has an 'almost-home' house with 6 places (in the beginning we start with 3 places) for care in the final phase of life for adults aged 18 and over for a period of 3 months. Hospice Amsterdam Zuidoost offers a small-scale facility with a warm and homely feel where people can be themselves and together with their loved ones can freely fulfill their wishes and needs. In addition, Hospice offers Amsterdam Zuidoost a temporary stay for people in respite care. This stay will be temporary because stay in the home situation is not possible at that time.
